Usually the first piece in a symphony is slow and thought out. The second is a little bit more playful allegro, vivace. Allegri Bouncy moving third movement is usually a minuet trio or oftentimes called a Scherzo. And the fourth movement is usually a mass culmination of everything that we've heard before and a new identity that's usually faster, full of energy and enthusiasm. And if you look at this nonstop mix, all these different sections follow similar patterns. We start off with servants of the scourge, then we move into scourge of the universe, followed by servants of the scourge."
